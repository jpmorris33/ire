	 Q: Could we just destroy the ship?
	 
	 "No.  And we will not help you do so.  Firstly, it is -our property-.  Without it we will be stranded here forever.
	 "Secondly, destroying the magicserver will result in many deaths... there are sentient creatures here whose metabolisms are partly magical and we cannot permit their extinction.
	 "Thirdly, destroying the ship would kill Xy'Lan.  Yes, his crimes are severe, but a wayward child must be corrected, not murdered.  Besides, he is not the only intelligence on the ship.
	 "Finally, if Xy'Lan believes his life is at risk, he will have nothing to lose.  The safety locks that prevent him harming higher lifeforms are stretched very thin as they are, and adding an existential threat... well, he may destroy the world."
	  
	 Q: Who counts as 'higher lifeforms'?
	 "Xy'Lan is not able to harm Drakaans directly owing to a constraint directive coded into his systems.  This is also why he has been reluctant to attack your aircraft.
	  Unfortunately, he has been killing and tormenting humans with happy abandon, so we may have set the intelligence threshold a bit too high."
	  
	 Q:If you leave, won't that kill the magical creatures too?
	 "Naturally we will put mitigations in place first.  With full control of the Maxima we could develop augmentations that will continue to function without the magicserver.
	  Alternatively, we can set up a less powerful server to keep such lifeforms viable, and secure it much more tightly to prevent others misusing it."

"The temple that humans call the 'Grand Cathedral' in the
 Holy Land is built on top of our ship, the Maxima.

 Access to the ship is likely through some private
 entrance available only to Pope."

"You have already found the computer room beneath the
 temple.  The entrance to the ship is likely close by.

 To prevent others entering the ship, Pope will have
 installed a barrier of some kind.  If I were him, I
 would arrange it such that it can only be unlocked
 with a special item kept on his person at all times.

 Depending on what that item is, it may be necessary
 to obtain a substitute so he does not notice its
 disappearance."

"Ah yes, the force barriers.

 Naavris says that this defence grid has an inspection 
 hatch nearby.  You may be able to cut the power line
 feeding it.

 There are likely to be suitable electronics tools in
 the air bases."

"The port power plant must be repaired.  Check the
 rectifier valves first, then the zeta links.

 If you need to hit the emergency shutdown, you will
 have to reset the circuit breakers afterwards.

 The breaker room is opposite the entrance to the
 ship's bridge.

 If you need to access the air conditioning ducts,
 a tool will be required.  There should be a spare
 lying around somewhere."

"Many thanks for your help in bringing down the barriers!

 When you are ready, there is more for you to look into.

 Commander Argus in the Panavius base has a couple of
 problems.  It would be helpful if you can look into
 these while we plan our next move.  Speak with him for
 more information."

"Right.  Engineer Naavris has detected a fault in one of
 the drive units.  Most likely this was caused by our
 stressing the drives when disabling the flight barriers.

 Either way, it will be necessary to replace the
 hyperspace modulator.

 Unfortunately, this is not a part which we have to hand.

 It was not felt necessary to carry spares since this
 part rarely fails and prior to Xy'Lan's fit we could
 just fabricate one on-demand by sending a prayer to the
 magic server."

"Fortunately, a lot of your technology is derived from
 ours.  As I may have mentioned, we seeded your race with
 key concepts and designs to improve your lot, so it may
 be that the part already exists on this world.

 We need to locate or fabricate a 3320 modulator.  It is
 what you call a microchip, with 18 pins.  I can send the
 specifications if you have suitable fabrication plants."

"Excuse me, but did you say you need a 3320 filter chip?
 We do have some keyboards which use those.
 They're really good for making brassy sounds.

 I had one here, but it went missing during the attack
 from the Church."

Commander Gurd's jaw drops open in disbelief and he
sounds genuinely appalled.

"What?!

 Are you telling me, that you took our 3320 hyperspace
 flux modulator - the pinnacle of Drakaan hyperspatial
 technology - AND USED IT TO MAKE STUPID NOISES?!"

"You didn't exactly leave us any instructions for any of
 this alien technology.  Mr. Curtis was trying to design
 a sound chip, so that's what he did.  It might not even
 work for whatever strange purpose you're envisaging.

 Either way, if you want one, you're going to have to
 find a synthesizer and borrow the chip from it.  The
 alternative is to wait a few weeks while Austin sets up
 his fabricator to manufacture one."

"This is true.  Very well...

 $PLAYERNAME, please talk to Stevens.
 Find out where his missing... music synthesizer... is
 and bring it to Austin.  Once he has extracted the chip,
 take it to the Maxima and swap out the faulty module.

 You may as well return it to Austin, as the failed chip
 may still work for manipulating audio signals even if it
 can no longer manipulate spacetime.

 Now go... I need to come to terms with this misuse of
 our technological gifts."
