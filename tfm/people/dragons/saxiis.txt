 promotes tool-use, you know?  Only meat-eaters become

 it came from the ground, the rest of it was extracted
 from the sea by Xy'lan as a reward for his Faithful.

 ants, hehehe.

"Well, I haven't seen it, but my sources tell me that
 on the morning of the new moon, Xy'lan gathers his high
 priests together for this gold ritual.
 Apparently they place some sacred pot on the high altar
 of the great cathedral, and it glows and when they take
 the pot off the altar again it is full of gold.

 All very showy, but dead simple to do with selective
 teleportation.  A byproduct of the ocean mineral
 extraction system that he uses to get raw materials to
 maintain the Maxima."

"There's a group of smart wolves in the southeast.
 I think they're the remains of some experiment by
 Xy'lan to try and create some worshippers.
 They live in the mountains on the edge of the desert,
 and they mine the ore-rich mountains.  Much of the
 iron and gold that humans use comes from their mines.
 Politics aside, there has been a lot of trade with the
 humans, for the wolves are not great craftsmen, and
 they have need of human-made goods.  I think they also
 import some foods which don't grow in the mountains."
