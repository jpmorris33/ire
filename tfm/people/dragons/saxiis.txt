 Apparently they place some sacred pot on the high altar

 the pot off the altar again it is full of gold.

 All very showy, but dead simple to do with selective

 I think they're the remains of some experiment by

 They live in the mountains on the edge of the desert,
 and they mine the ore-rich mountains.  Much of the
 iron and gold that humans use comes from their mines.
 Politics aside, there has been a lot of trade with the
 humans, for the wolves are not great craftsmen, and
 they have need of human-made goods.  I think they also
 import some foods which don't grow in the mountains."
