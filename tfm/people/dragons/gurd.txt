"Salutations, $PLAYERNAME.

 Welcome to our humble home.  I am Commander Gurd, of
 the Dra'kaan research ship Maxima.

 I wish to explain the origins of the malevolent god
 Xy'lan, who stalks this world, performing dark miracles.
 My crew can also supply you with magic if you need it.

 But first, take this device.  It is a communicator which
 will allow us to contact you."

"Hundreds of your years ago our ship, the Maxima, was
 built.. the third vessel to be equipped with a new type
 of drive system, and all the on-board systems were run
 by an experimental computer sentience called "Xy'lan".

 We took the Maxima on her maiden voyage to gather data
 about the worlds in a volume of space we could not
 reach before the new drive was invented.

 A repair was made to some auxiliary computer systems,
 and this impacted Xy'lan's datacore.  Something went
 wrong and he became psychotic and said he was God."

"When we refused to worship him, Xy'lan took command of
 the Maxima.  But before he did, we managed to stall the
 engines and the ship collided with this world.

 The Maxima's stasis fields protected us all from
 annihilation, but the impact must have rendered this
 continent uninhabitable for centuries.

 What happened next is unclear.  The Maxima had several
 independent stasis fields, and it seems that Xy'lan
 managed to prevent the crew stasis fields from shutting
 down, keeping us trapped in a zero-time state."

"We do not know if Xy'lan thinks he is a god, or if he

 matter, since the Maxima contains a device that is able
 to perform what you would call 'miracles'.

 Xy'lan started looking for worshippers immediately, but
 at the time we crashed, this world had only primitive
 animal life.

 However, the Maxima was carrying universal nano-devices
 which could be used to stimulate the development of
 intelligence in the native fauna.  Xy'lan seems to have
 done this, for we detect other intelligent races."

 enslave them.

 That might also be how we were released from stasis.. a
 momentary lapse of concentration.  Or perhaps he needed
 to divert power away from the stasis generators to work
 enough miracles for the new religion.  We may never know.

 But now we are free, and Xy'lan must be stopped!"

 Your peoples were a bit primitive then.  The smartest
 people lived on a really huge continent and had narrow
 eyes like us.

 When we introduced ourselves, they called us 'dragons'

 all and said that we were evil serpents and daevas in
 the pay of the evil 'Angra Mainyu'.

 They were very rude and tried to kill us.  And because
 these people were so influential, all the bad things

"I'll just give you an overview.  Ask Librarian Rulyz if
 you wish to know more about the science involved.

 Basically, our race discovered a technique that allows
 one to affect the universe in interesting ways.
 It is very complex, but when controlled by a computing
 engine it allows arbitrary changes to reality itself
 on demand.
 
 The normal setup is to have a 'magic server' which
 listens out for prayers and incantations and carries
 them out."

"Users are granted different privilege levels, for
 safety reasons.

 Beginners can be restricted to the safest and easiest
 spells.  More dangerous spells need higher privilege
 levels to make them work.

 With enough privilege and access to the server itself
 it is possible to create new spells.

 Since this technique is so useful, it is used in most of
 our technology.  So the Maxima carries a magicserver of
 its own.  We called it 'The CoDec of ultimate power'.
