"We mine corpses, kid.  A very lucrative trade, y'know.

 We had a real good strike at the last dig site, a
 funny little place with flat, square rocks everywhere.
 
 And would ya believe it, kid, EVERY ONE of those lil'
 marble slabs had a body under it!  We stood to make a
 killin', but those goddam villagers went ballistic.

 Came at us with torches, pitchforks.  We had to run for
 it.  Must've broken some local taboo or somethin'."

"Oh, that's just a little song we sing when we're
 workin'.  It's called 'After The Flesh', and it's by a
 band called 'My Life With The Thrill-Kill Cult'.
 Part of the soundtrack from The Crow.

 Ugly sings the vocals.  Dopey sings the guitar parts,
 Fatso does the bassline, Girly and I chant the samples,
 and Surly sings the drums.

 We don't usually let Stupid sing, 'cos he just howls."

"Why, she was a puppy who ran away from a wicked witch
 and ended up here.  We let her stay if she'd help us by
 guardin' the house while we're out mining.

 That worked out pretty well for a long time, but
 eventually the witch found out where she was, and
 spiked her dogfood.

 Fortunately, the LORD intervened and she fell into a
 coma instead of dyin'.  If someone holy, like you, can
 give her a kiss, she should wake up again."

"No, kid.  She's a wolf.. an arctic wolf.

 But since she came, we found our clothes nice and clean,
 and a fine meal waiting for us on the table.

 Now I ain't sure, but I think she's a werewolf.  It'd
 make sense.. see, if she only turns human during the
 daytime, when we're out workin'.

 I've heard stories of werewolves before, but I never
 thought I'd see one."
