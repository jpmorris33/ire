"'After The Flesh' by My-Life-With-The-Thrill-Kill-Cult.
  We always sing it while we're working.

 I used to use a Sequential Pro-One for the bassline, but
 the LORD tried to take it away so we buried it.

 Now I have to sing the bassline.
 Ugly sings the vocals.  Dopey sings the guitar parts,
 and Girly and Sleazy chant the samples.  Surly sings
 the drum parts.  Stupid isn't allowed to sing."

"Oh, she was a sporty little girl who ran away from home
 and turned up here.  We decided to take care of her, and
 in exchange she helped us by washing our clothes and
 cooking our food.

 It's too bad she's dead now.  We have to take it in
 turns to cook, and someone has to watch Dopey when it's
 his turn to make sure he doesn't try to "pep it up".

 Yeah, it was just too bad.  Some evil witch turned up
 and gave her some poisoned fruit.

 But I believe that she is not dead, only sleeping, and
 that someday she will return to lead us to glory!

 Wait, I may be thinking of Jesus instead.  Or Cthulhu.."
