Something goes wrong and Ya'Do is unable to revive the
deceased.
After attemping the kiss of life, and trying to convince
you that they are alive again with a tacky display of
puppetry and ventriloquism, Ya'Do changes the subject
and tries to sell you some more spells in the hopes that 
you'll forget about the 400 gold coins.

Ya'Do makes a sour expression and mutters curses at you.

"Master is always right, apprentice, you'll see!
 Soon, hmm!

 Here is your stupid money.  Take it and scram, yes!"
