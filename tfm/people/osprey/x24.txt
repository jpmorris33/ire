You remove the fish from your backpack and dangle it in
front of the osprey.

The bird stares longingly at the fish, but eventually
closes both eyes to avoid the temptation.

 Away with you!"

"The men of the New God.. they do not trust us and we
 do not trust them.

 Just as the weak lose their fisshh to the eagle, so we
 too must remain ever vigilant.  For it may be that they
 will one day decide to raid our village and steal our
 eggs and our fisshh.

 The bridge makes that hard for them to do."

 You have betrayed us, and for that, you must die."
