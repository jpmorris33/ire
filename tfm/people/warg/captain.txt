 King Redtooth dethroned Grey's brother Swiftrunner, who
 was next in the line of succession.  Swiftrunner did not
 have Grey's golden touch, and although he was a

 felt that Swiftrunner was too weak to defend the realm

 force.  I would not speak of it in his presence, as it

"King Grey was mysteriously slain during the war with the
 humans.  Most of our people believe that he was the best
 king we have ever had, and mourn his loss even now.

 After his death, Grey's brother Swiftrunner ascended to
 the throne, and although he was popular, he was also
 inexperienced, and lacked the intuitive brilliance of
 his elder brother.

 At the time, RedTooth was an ambitious general who felt
 that Swiftrunner was too weak to hold the realm in the
 face of the human foe."

[nextpage="grey2"]

"RedTooth's ambition led him to usurp Swiftrunner's
 throne in a coup, banishing him to the wilderness.
 But although he convinced the royal guard that
 Swiftrunner was weak and should be dethroned,
 he has never been able to convince the people and has
 lived in the shadow of Grey's brilliance and Swift's
 charisma.

 Because of this, King RedTooth feels insecure and his
 rule has been distinctly more harsh than that of his
 predecessors.  The King has been known to lash out at
 groups that he feels are too powerful and may threaten
 his claim to the throne."

"Although I am the captain of the guard, and personally
 responsible for the King's safety, I too miss the days
 of kings past.

 Lately I have been growing unsure of King Redtooth's
 motives.  Our kings are sworn to uphold the law and
 protect the citizens, but my liege has not seen fit to
 rebuild their homes.  His subjects live in huts made
 from sticks and thatch, while he lives in a sumptious
 palace.  Although this saddens me, it is something I
 could ignore.. after all, the King may have good reason
 for this state of affairs.

 But I have discovered something recently that has made
 me question my King's motives once more."

"Well, it began with the Temple of Aa'Ruuff.
 This is easy enough to understand, since it was the evil
 God Aa'Ruuff who sent His human followers to attack us.

 Indeed, many wondered why it was that Grey never moved
 against the brethren in the first place, although I once
 heard SwiftRunner say that it was left be in the hopes
 that our rift with Aa'Ruuff the Betrayer would in time
 be healed.

 When RedTooth came to power, the temple was desecrated
 and all it's finery plundered.  He outlawed all worship
 of the Betrayer.  This opened a few eyes, but did not
 cause much of a problem with the people, since most of
 them understandably despised the Betrayer."

"The Weaver's Guild was the next target of my liege.
 That too made a certain amount of sense, for they had
 become powerful and owned a great deal of land in the
 Realm.  Cloth is greatly important, and a threat from
 the Guild to cease production was a powerful threat
 indeed.

 Saying that they were planning treason, King RedTooth
 broke the Guild, and most of the weavers were jailed.
 Only the apprentices were left, to ensure a continued
 supply of cloth and thread.  They were forbidden from
 forming any kind of guild or union on penalty of jail.

 Some began to wonder if the King had broken the Guild
 only so that he could sieze their land and wealth, and
 some of these waarg found themselves in jail also.
 But most were happy for the King charged less rent for
 the use of their land than the Guild had done."

"Finally, King RedTooth struck out at the Seers.
 There are those who can See glimpses of other places and
 other times, both past and yet to come.
 In days gone by these prophets would hold great
 ceremonies, or Seeings, where they would try to See the
 future.

 At one of these Seeings, a prophet saw a vision of King
 RedTooth's dethronement.  The King was most greatly
 angered and it took all the persuasion of myself and
 SpellThrower combined to prevent him from executing the
 prophet on the spot.  Instead the prophet was banished,
 and the gift of Seeing was denounced as a tool of the
 Betrayer.  Seeings were outlawed and none now dare admit
 to possessing the Gift."

"I am the King's councillor on military affairs, and so I

 Incursion by human raiders is something I am ever

 sightings of unauthorised human activity to me.

 You are excepted, of course, since you have chosen to
 wear the Favour as a token of peace, but you must know
 that we fear humans and have little to do with your kind
 when we can avoid it.

 for Aa'Ruuff is still against us at this time.

 There are also restrictions on what can be traded,
 chiefly metals and ore from our mines.. and the fine
 purple cloth which the humans pay such high prices for.
 All this is done openly.

 What worries me is that someone appears to be trading in
 secret.. why would they do that unless they have

(a parchment in English detailing a sale of n barrels of military

 SteelJaw can't read English.. by custom only Kings are permitted

 You can't present this as proof to the court because only the
 King can read it and he'll simply deny it.
 The only other living Waarg who can read English is Swiftrunner
 and he's been exiled and cannot enter the city by law.

 SteelJaw reasons that if the Church is involved they should
 have some Waargish documents incriminating them.  Since you
 can't read Waarg yourself, you'll need a Waarg to help you locate
 the documents.

 Swiftrunner won't join you, but one of SteelJaw's men will.
 When you meet King Grey, he will join.. you must have him
 to log in to the systems anyway.

When you find the documents they reveal that RedTooth sold out
to Xy'Lan.. betraying King Grey in exchange for the Throne.

Grey back to the Waarg city and overthrow the King directly)
