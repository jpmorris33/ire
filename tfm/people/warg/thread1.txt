You see a large wolf-like creature, with a white front
paw.  He looks at you nervously, but relaxes somewhat
upon seeing your collar.

"I am Snow-paw, the threadmaster.  I provide thread to
 the weavers.

 My family has been in this trade for many generations
 and we have refined the techniques of threadmaking over
 this time.

 We can supply anything from the thinnest fibre, to the
 strongest ropes for boats and building."

"Our thread is made from the bark of the Yrmwat bush,
 the plants that grow on my farmland.
 
 When they are ripe, we gather the harvest, and strip
 the bark off so it can be spun into thread."

"The bushes are most useful.  Their bark is tough and
 fibrous.  When stripped off and treated, it can be spun
 into thread or rope.

 When dried, the leaves have medicinal purposes as well.

 Some say that the bush was a gift from Aa'Ruuf.
 I do not know.."

"It can be done by mouth and paw, but the job is hard
 work.  It is much easier to use magic.
 
 Centuries ago the spell was given to my ancestors
 by Aa'Ruuf, and it has been passed down from father
 to son ever since."

"The spinning wheel is of an old design, given to us by
 our God, Aa'Ruuff, before he turned against his people.

 It does not seem well suited to our kind, for we have to
 use a little spell to thread it.
 
 But after it has been threaded, it can be run 
 continuously without any further magic."

He deftly takes out a small pouch from his backpack,
and opens it out for you, watching intently as each coin
falls into the purse.

Then, closing the purse, he pulls out a coil of rope with
his mouth, and drops the bundle neatly at your feet.
You stoop to pick it up.

You see a wolf-like creature.  One of his paws is white.
Suddenly he notices you and bounds away in terror.
