"I cannot help you with that.  Transmutation is
 exceptionally difficult, even for The Betrayer.
 Lead can be turned into gold by one skilled in the arts

 the resulting gold is deadly poisonous.

 If you would seek your fortune, there is much gold to
 be found in the mines of the northeast."

"In years past, I asked this of Aa'Ruuff.  I do not
 understand all of what He told me, but He did say that
 lead has 82 protons, and gold only 79.

 To make gold, lead must therefore be split into gold.
 When a thing is split a dangerous energy is released
 that harms living things.  And worse, when the lead has
 been split, there are three protons left over.  These
 may in turn collide with other pieces of gold or lead,
 which may cause them to split in turn, releasing yet
 more dangerous energies.

 I saw a transmutation, many, many years ago.
 The gold was extremely poisonous, and glowed blue in the
 night.  Aa'Ruuff Himself had to intervene.  He removed
 the deadly glow from the gold, and He healed all those
 who had seen the glow.  If He had not done so, we would
 surely have died."

 However I do not use this power, and I do not know of
 many who do, for such gifts did fall out of favour with
 our new King.

 In the days before Aa'Ruuff betrayed us, there were many
 more who had the gift, and great Seeings were held at
 the temple on the night of the full moon, where groups
 would enter the trance and open their minds to that
 which was yet to come."

 But time is complicated, for the future is not fixed.  And
 because of this, not all the prophecies agree.  But by 
 counting how many see each possibility, it is possible to
 determine how likely such events are.


 Ah, you wish to know of the prophecy of the King and the
 Promised One?

 There were twenty prophets gathered for the Seeing.  Of
 these, all foresaw that a Promised one would appear to
 challenge Aa'Ruuff.  Most saw that he would gather one
 companion to champion each race of those upon the world,
 and many foresaw that he would fail and die, and that
 Aa'Ruuff would reign without contest.

 One single prophet saw clearly the champion of the Waarg
 race.. and it was our dead King Grey, back from the grave!
 I am sure you agree how likely THAT prophecy is."

[where can I find this prophet, if he still lives?
 In a cave in the ????]


"The Seeings take place when the moon is full.  I do not
 know why, but it affects the clarity of the visions.
 They can only truly take place at the hour when the moon
 is at its peak.  As the moon wanes the power dwindles
 very rapidly, and until the night when the moon is full
 the visions are vague and lack clarity.

 But it works both ways also, for the visions that are
 seen are only ever visions of events that will take
 place on a day of the full moon.
 Thus it happened that the Betrayal took place 'neath
 the new moon, and since it was over and done before the
 next moon, we saw could only the war, not the events
 that triggered it.
