"I am a glass-blower.  I make bowls for eating from,
 and potion bottles for the apothecar and court mage.
 I can also make other items such as jars which we
 trade with the human folk on occasion.

 I have heard one of their main glassmakers has
 been arrested, so trade has been more brisk than
 usual.

 Potion bottles are 5 gold coins, jars are 6, and
 bowls are 3 gold coins each."
