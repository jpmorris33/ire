 In times past, I sold all manner of things, but now I
 specialise in the selling and use of Black Dust.

 Do you seek to purchase some?"

"The Black Dust is a fine powder made by the King's
 Armsmen.  When lit with fire, it will explode with
 violent force.  As such, it has a great many military
 uses, but it is also good for mining and the digging
 of tunnels.

 The dust I sell is suitable for mining."

"It formed part of our advantage against the humans
 during the war, for they seem not to know how it is
 made.  We do not know why Aa'Ruuff has not yet told
 the humans, for The Betrayer knows all..

 I am willing to sell you some of the Dust, for you wear
 the Favour, and I think not that you would be able to
 work out how the dust is made from any I provide."

"The Black Dust was a secret, but is not any longer.
 The recipe is a secret though, and only the King's
 Armsmen and engineers know how it is made.

 The Dust I sell is weaker, for civil use.  The army
 has a stock of much more pure Dust which they use to
 help defend our Land."
