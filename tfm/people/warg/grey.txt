Grey won't believe you are the Promised One until you
give him suitable proof.  But what?

"What?  You must know who I am.. surely!

 I am Grey, king of the Waarg.  Your Dark Master turned
 against us, His faithful worshippers, and tried to
 enslave His own people!

 I had communed with Him many times over the years, and
 learned many things from my God.
 But one of those things, He has forgotten, and now He
 wants very badly for me to tell Him what it was.

 But I shall never tell Him!  NEVER!"

 suffered something like.. a 'stroke', I believe you say.

 I do not know exactly what happened, for Aa'Ruuff does
 not suffer from the ailments of our earthly forms.

 But whatever happened, it left Aa'Ruuff insane for
 a few minutes, and when He had recovered His sanity,
 several important facts were missing from His mind."

"Truly?

 Over the years, many of our mages and seers have given
 prophecy about the one that the humans call the
 'Promised One'.

 It is written that this one shall gather a band of many
 races.  There shall be a dragon, a buzzard, a fish-hawk
 and a Waarg.

 Some interpretations of the visions say that I am the
 Waarg who will join the Promised One. "

"On occasion I have heard the human guards speak of
 an Adversary, one whom they believe the Betrayer
 protects them against.

 Find this adversary and bring a token from them...
 an artifact so blasphemous that the Betrayer's
 minions would not be caught dead with it in
 their possession.  A book of forbidden magic,
 for instance!

 If you do this, then I shall accept your word
 that you are not one of Aa'Ruuff's lackeys."

The Devil suggests the Necronomicon which he's lent to two satanic monks, Brother Karloff and Brother Lugosi.
If you fetch it, he'll sign it for you, but warns that it's dangerous to read it.  The Waarg should be immune, though,
since Xy'Lan had taught them magic anyway.

Satan signs it "To King Grey, lots of love, Satan"

!!! Waarg in the cushy parts of Hell?

 I am King Grey, of the Waarg, and you have my eternal

 I was kept here by our God, Aa'Ruuff.  He was trying to

 walk upon four legs instead of two.

 It is said that our people were created by Aa'Ruuff,
 whom we worshipped as our God, before He turned His
 back upon us.

 The legends say that there were animals like us but
 dumb, and that Aa'Ruuff raised us up to intelligence
 using His power.  He also made our bodies strong
 and long-lived, which proved a great advantage in
 the war against the humans."

"It is our tradition that names are given on the night
 of the sixth full moon after a cub has been born.

 The name is taken from the first impression that the
 cub gives the town elders on the night of the naming
 ceremony.

 Often it is the cub's behaviour, such as 'QuickJaw',
 but it is often taken from a cub's appearance, too,
 such as 'SnowPaw'.

 I was called 'GreyCoat' because my fur is strangely
 light for my people.  We are usually darker colours.

 Sometimes, a favoured King or Noble is given a title,
 or a different name by their subjects.  The people
 named me 'King Grey' as a token of affection."

"Several years ago, I was king of the city-state of Yapp,
 a powerful waarg stronghold.  As God's annointed ruler,
 I frequently had communion with the great God Aa'Ruuff
 Himself, and He told me many useful things.
 
 One interesting thing I learned was a code that gives
 access to the source of Aa'Ruuff's power.

 One day, Aa'Ruuff announced that we were no longer His
 favourite race, and that our city would be invaded by
 His new champion, mankind.  That night our priests
 cursed our God's name, and henceforth we referred to
 Him as 'The Betrayer'."

[nextpage="code2"]

[page="code2"]

"Aa'Ruuff was true to His loathsome word, but I devised
 a series of cunning strategies to protect our land from
 His onslaught.  Aa'Ruuff Himself stayed out of the
 battle, but occasionally He visited me in the evenings
 when I was in session with my advisors.  He would offer
 taunts or sarcastic comments.

 One night, it was as if Aa'Ruuff was delirious.  
 His voice was slurred and He spoke in fragments that made 
 no sense.  Little pink wet things appeared in the tops
 of trees, and we later found that all our wine had 
 been turned into fruit juice overnight.

 After a few minutes, Aa'Ruuff stopped rambling and He 
 began to say things we could understand again.  We may
 never know what happened to Him that night, but while
 He was insane, He had lost a number of important facts
 from His memory."

[nextpage="code3"]
[endpage]


[page="code3"]

"After the 'stroke', or whatever happened to our God,
 Aa'Ruuff's manner changed.  The sarcastic banter that
 He often used with me was dropped and He became more
 ruthless and threatening.

 One day, when I was hunting rabbits with my brother,
 a human dressed in black was seen in the distance.
 When my guards went to investigate, another human 
 appeared behind me.  He aimed a weapon at my head, and
 then the blackness claimed me."

"I awoke surrounded by human guards loyal to Aa'Ruuff.
 Then He appeared before me.  The guards took me to
 this dungeon.  It seems that the Betrayer had ordered
 me to be killed, and then He had resurrected me with
 His power so that I could be questioned.

 Aa'Ruuff's lackeys have been questioning me ever since.
 He wants to know just one thing... the access code that
 He revealed to me all those years ago!

 But I shall never tell Him!"

"Centuries ago, our people were visited by a God that we
 call Aa'Ruuff.  He taught us many things, such as how to
 manipulate objects by thought alone, and build houses.

 Aa'Ruuff would answer our prayers and show Himself
 before us from time to time.  We worshipped Him for five
 centuries, and vast temples were built in His honour.

 Not long ago, Aa'Ruuff told us that there were new
 creatures in the world that He called 'humans'.

 Aa'Ruuff started to become fickle and irritable.  We
 didn't know why at the time, but it seems now that He
 was more interested in the humans than His chosen ones."

"Finally Aa'Ruuff appeared in our holiest temple and said
 that we were no longer any use to Him, and that we
 would all be destroyed by his new worshippers, Mankind.

 I mobilised our armies and the war against humanity 
 began.  Aa'Ruuff stayed out of the way.  I am convinved
 now that He had engineered the conflict to see which
 race was strongest.

 Many of us were routed but there were few losses,
 because Aa'Ruuff had changed us to make our bodies
 stronger."

"The humans concentrated on destroying our temples
 and our homes, and when this was done we were largely
 left alone, apart from occasional raiding parties,
 bandits and zealots come to destroy the 'Infidel', or
 'Devils' or whatever it is they call us.

 The betrayal by Aa'Ruuff overturned our entire social
 structure, and the resulting chaos is probably the main
 reason why the humans left us alone."

Tell me the code

"I cannot.  It is not a code like the pass-phrases that
 we use among our guards, it is.. shapes and numbers..
 colours and smells.. they all come together in my mind.

 I think that to enter the code, you will be asked
 several of many possible questions, and that you have
 to give the right answers no matter which questions
 are asked.

 This is one of the reasons that Aa'Ruuff has difficulty
 extracting the code from me."

<Xy'lan has changed the original code so the Dra'kaan don't know it>

How did Aa'Ruuff tell you the code?

"I do not know.  I fell asleep one day and dreamed a
 dream of whisperings and strange feelings.

 I think that he placed the code in my mind to see if it
 would work.  But for some reason he cannot do anything
 similar to read the code back again.

 Perhaps he needs to have the code first..."
