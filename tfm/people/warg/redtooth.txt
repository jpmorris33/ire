 This world is a harsh one, and the Betrayer poses a
 constant threat to us.  Only the strong survive, and
 the weak perish.

 That is the key to my policies.  A ruler must be strong,
 even ruthless at times, for a nation is only so strong
 as its leader."

 was weak.

 His foolish indecision crippled our nation and because

 A weak leader is a threat to us all, for such a waarg
 would offer no protection against the might of the
 Betrayer and we would again find ourselves in his thrall
 or wiped from the face of the world.

 It takes a strong leader with an iron paw to protect our
 land against evil.

 I am such a leader; Swiftrunner was not - He had to go."
