Leader of the Guard

[page="start"]

[colour="#808080"]
You see a wolf-like creature in armour with a curious weapon attached to a
harness around his back.  He speaks in a strange, snarling voice.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Stop!  What humans are you that wish to enter the city of the Waarg?

 Who are you, and what do you want?"

"You certainly are!

 But, as worshippers of Aa'Ruuff the Betrayer, I must insist you leave at once
 or face detention as enemies of our people."

The creature steps backwards in surprise.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"What?  Do you not worship the Betrayer?

 Aa'Ruuff taught us to build and keep livestock.  We worshipped Him for
 centuries, but He turned against us and sent His human worshippers to kill us!"

[link="I don't worship Aa'Ruuff."]

"What does it look like?
 I'm guarding the city entrance against humans!

 Humans worship the evil God Aa'Ruuff who tried to annihilate US, his own
 faithful worshippers!

 Humans are not welcome here after the war brought about by His evil, and
 YOUR complicity!"

The creature snarls angrily and snaps at the air.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"The Trinity does not exist!  It is a fabrication of Aa'Ruuff that He uses
 to obtain your worship.

 You still worship Him, whatever name He goes by!
 If you are devotees of the Betrayer, then leave now!"

[link="I don't REALLY worship the trinity."]

The creature stiffens.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"You just say that so you can get into our city and KILL US ALL!"

[link="No, I pretend to worship the Trinity so they don't kill me."]

[link="Oops, you saw through me.  Got to go!"]

The creature's ears prick up.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Really?  You mean you are a fugitive from Aa'Ruuff as well?
 Perhaps you are not our enemy.

 I will take you to our leader.  He will decide the truth."

[page="aboutwar"]

"What?!?  You do not know of the war?

 Perhaps you are not hostiles.. I'm not sure whether to trust you.

 I will take you to our leader.
 He will decide what to do."

[page="no_aaruuf"]

"You don't worship the Betrayer?

 If that is so, then you are not necessarily our enemies..
 ..but you are not necessarily our friends, either.

 I don't trust you.  Trusting a people who tried to wipe us out comes hard.

 But I will take you to our leader.
 He will decide what to do with you."

The creature sniffs and returns to duty.

"Hmmph!"

"What?  You expect me to abscond from my sworn duty, and join you for
 no obvious reason???

 Okay then."
