"It was a job.  I got some good stuff done.
 Made things fairer for a lot of people.

 'Course, the guy after me tried to tear it all down
 again, but that's humans for you.

 I've served my two terms, though.  A lot of people
 wanted me back, but... well, you don't want to mess
 with that kind of safeguard, especially when your
 ruler could be a machine intelligence with an
 indefinite lifespan.
	  
 Even a good ruler might turn bad in the end, being able
 to swap them out after a while is crucially important."

"Not really.  The world is a lot more boring than
 most people would like to think.

 I was President of the USA for eight years, and
 I did a lot of digging around in that time, kid.

 The CIA didn't hold anything back from me, because
 they didn't even know I was looking.  I broke into
 many systems.

 Area 51 was just an experimental facility for
 advanced weapons.  There were never any alien ships
 there, but it made a good cover story.
 Strictly they were UFOs, but they were entirely
 designed and built on Earth."

"Right.  Hyperdrive technology works by warping space
 in front of a starship, creating a portal which allows
 instantaneous travel.

 By creating a smaller portal, say a couple of
 millimetres across, you can send a laserbeam through
 the portal, and thereby transmit information
 instantaneously instead."

 in order to operate.  And that needs a LOT of power,
 more than we can generate locally.  The base is linked
 to a dam in the southeast mountains.

 Thanks to you, we have it all operational again, and
 we should be able to warn Earth of the crisis here."

 Unfortunately, it's not working.  Argus is looking for

 after instead of leaving you to decompose.
 Most people aren't so lucky!"
	 
 As for preventing it... well, some of the Churchies
 have been talking about seeing the Devil.
 While I'm not sure worshipping evil is a great idea in
 a place like this, it's possible that it might know a
 way to bypass the LORD, if only to annoy them."

"If it's any consolation, it's almost certainly NOT
 the actual Devil.  More likely it's poor sod who's
 been brainwashed into THINKING he is, and given
 powers to match.

 But, it's also very possible that it's the
 incarnation of some opposing power, possibly even
 multiple personality disorder on the part of whatever
 it is that's behind all this.  Probably a computer."

"We managed to get some books from the humans before
 everything went sideways.

 One of them mentions that grouse worship the Evil One.
 That was a local myth on Earth at one point in the
 remote past, but here, it might actually be true!
	  
 Asking the humans where you can find the Devil is
 unlikely to end well, but asking after the grouse might
 work.  You could try asking in Avis, a human settlement
 north of here."

 Whatever it is, it's very powerful and is roleplaying

"Whatever's doing all this is powerful, yes.  But it
 makes mistakes, too.  Too many to make me think it's a
 supernatural phenomenon.

 Lots of science fiction stories have a god that turns
 out to be a super-powerful alien or a supercomputer or
 something, and since we've never encountered it before
 landing on this planet, it's clearly been trapped here.

 I'd split the difference  and lay money on it being
 some kind of alien supercomputer."

"I had a Pro One, an actual relic from the 1980s, not
 a modern reproduction.  It cost me a fortune.

 Shortly after the Church attacked us, I found it was
 missing. The weird thing is it was definitely there
 immediately afterwards.

 One of the panthers reported seeing seven dwarfs in
 the vicinity, so it may be that they took it before
 we were able to put Death on guard duty."
