"In my time I was a gifted painter.  If you have seen the
 Great Cathredral, you may have seen my renditions of the
 Creation, the Last Supper and the Saviour attending the
 stoning of a sinner.

 Alas, my final painting saw me burned for heresy.
 It seemed like a good idea at the time.

 Since it seems I have an eternity ahead of me,
 I have taken up painting once more."

"This surprises many of the newcomers, but Hell is a
 disputed territory.  The LORD wishes it as a place of
 torment for those who have sinned against the Trinity.

"The Devil sees it as his realm as the scriptures have
 often said.  Those in his territory are treated well,
 that they may serve him faithfully when the end of
 days should come.

 It seems that the LORD doth wield the stick, while
 the Devil doth wield the carrot.  And some do say
 that carrots are the Devil's favourite food.

 Be that as it may, the Dark One was particularly
 taken with my painting of the Conception of Christ,
 and has given me all I need here to continue my art."

"You seek to leave?  It is said there is an artifact
 what would allow one to return to the world of men.
 However, we would once more become mortal, and the
 LORD and his servants would be greatly displeased.

 Myself, I shall stay here.  Being burned was a most
 painful death, one that I wish not to endure again."
