 was sent here to rescue.  I dare not return openly for
 I shall surely lose my head, so I am living in exile.

 But I sometimes have need to deal with men on behalf of
 the dragon.. in such times I disguise myself as a monk.

 I worry that one day the nobleman may learn of my crime
 and send the king's men to take me to the gallows-tree,
 or more likely the headsman.
 But the dragon has vowed to protect me should soldiers
 ever approach the keep."

"I was sent to the castle to slay a foul worm and rescue
 the fair maid Grizelda held captive by the beast.

 I travelled for many days and nights to reach the tower,
 and in the dead of night, when the beast was sleeping I
 scaled the walls with a rope I had woven from vines.

 I prowled the rooms of the dark tower without light
 until I came across a room where a huge, bloated dim
 shape rose and fell with an unearthly sound.

 Taking my longsword, I plunged it deep into the belly of
 the monster, which screamed and died.

 Then the dragon entered, holding a candle."

"The dragon looked at me, and then looked at the bed, and
 then looked at me again.  Then it placed the candle upon
 the nightstand and gave a gigantic whoop of joy.

 By the light of the dragon's torch, I saw that I had
 slain an ugly fat girl who snores.  I cowered, waiting
 for the wyrm to strike me down with a death-blow or
 roast me with the searing heat of its breath, but
 instead it turned and asked me to help remove the body."

"We dug a grave for the fat maiden.  It took all night
 and I quailed, knowing that I should face beheading

 But the dragon made me an offer I could not refuse;
 shelter and protection in exchange for my service."

 His speciality is in acquiring items of value without

 I have had dealings with him on occasion, much though I
 loathe his company.  Most recently I ran into him at the
 Flying Trout in Lakeside.  I understand that he was
 trying to recruit a warrior thief to obtain for him a
 heavily-guarded item of great value for his employer."

 Edwyg's guards.
