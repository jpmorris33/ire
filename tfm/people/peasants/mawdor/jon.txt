"Aye.  There have been a number of disappearances
 of late, and some fear that a mad murderer may be
 on the loose.

 Also, while picking hearbs to the west of our town,
 I did see a number of dwarven folk prospecting for
 gold or gems.  They were singing a harsh lament
 about the torments of Hell."

"I have a selection of potions I can sell you.
 They are dyed so that you can tell which is which.

 The green potions are poison that is useful for
 slaying rats and keeping livestock free from lice.

 Red potions are a fast-acting antidote to most toxins,
 including snake venom and the rat poison.

 Yellow potions are restorative and allow wounds to heal
 very rapidly.  Blue potions induce a refreshing sleep.

 We also have black potions that can render the user
 invisible, but they are most expensive since the
 unscrupulous may use them to commit evil deeds."
