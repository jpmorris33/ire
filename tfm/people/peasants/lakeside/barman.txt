"In these parts it is not so uncommon to see a trout fly
 though the air.  The lakes nearby are home to fish-hawks
 that dive for fish and seize them in their talons.

 They do fly back to their nests holding the fish to
 devour it on the spot or feed them to their hawklings.

 Trout is their favourite fish."

 As for their allegiance in the great battle of creation,
 of that we are uncertain.

 Some say that they do bring good luck, but I am not so
 sure..  Han the tailor says that there is a large
 fish-hawk that perches by his house every day and
 watches him always.

 I wonder that it may be they are spies of the LORD.. or
 maybe even The Adversary!"

"It is a ferocious beast that lives in the keep to the
 northwest of our village.  Every fortnight it would come
 to our village, causing panic and terror.  Our warriors
 would try to slay it, but the creature's skin is tough.
 It would fight back, and many men were slain.

 We lost too many men for this to continue, so instead we
 did build many tunnels and cellars to hide in when the
 beast came.  It would take a pig or two and begone.
 Funny it is, but sometimes it did leave behind a small
 lump of gold or more."

 Yet, not so long ago, a man did come on such a quest..

 Although some do say they have seen a cloaked stranger
 going to and from the keep."
