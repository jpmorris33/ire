 me from death at the stake, I have taken refuge in these

 Yet I shall make no more telescopes, that is certain!"

"I make glassware.  Since I am in your debt, I shall sell
 you these items much less than I would normally charge.

 I can sell you wineglasses for 3 gold each, jars for 2
 gold, and potion flasks for 10.  These are sundry items.

 I also make glass orbs, which many find useful for the
 mystical arts that the LORD allows men to practice.
 These orbs are not easy to craft, but I can still offer
 one to you for 250 gold."

"Also, because I owe you my life, I can forge for you
 a secret weapon, the crystal sword.  I must ask 1500
 golds, and I will need two todestones to make it.

 This is a magical weapon, and most deadly, but the
 sword's power is only released as the blade shatters,
 so use it only in dire need.  Tell no-one of it."
