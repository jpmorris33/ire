"I found a heathen text.  It explained some of the
 miracles of the Ancients.  Using it, I made a device
 called a 'telescope' that lets one to see into Heaven.

 The Church found out and accused me of heresy and
 witchcraft.  They said that I was trying to disprove the
 Lord's word on the Creation.

 The LORD himself appeared as plaintiff at my trial, and I
 was condemnned to die."
