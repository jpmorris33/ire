You see a bearded man standing behind a bar.
His movements are swift and posessed of an almost catlike
grace and agility.

"Monsters are once again coming down from the hills,
 threatening us and our livestock.  The shepherds quail,
 fearing that they may end up like Noram did last year.

 But all this does provide good trade for adventurers,
 and for me also, as I do rent my rooms out to men who
 would seek their fortunes."

"Last spring Noram the shepherd disappeared while tending
 his flock.  They say he was eaten by his own sheep..
 a very bad business, that.

 It seems likely to me that mimics have invaded the
 flocks.  No-one would know until they were eaten, for
 mimics are greatly cunning and do also act like the
 thing that they took the form of.

 If this be true it bodes ill, for we will not be able to
 sort the true sheep from the false when it comes to
 the shearing season.. which may become a bloodbath."

[page="monsters"]

"They live in the caves to the north.  About this time
 they will come down from the mountains in search of
 food.

 Mostly there are trolls, but sometimes also mimics.
 Although they are not monsters, there are also bands of
 wandering brigands.

 The problem has become big enough that we depend upon
 wandering heros to keep things in order.  Avis was once
 famous for its markets, but now it is a focal point for
 adventurers."

[page="dragons"]

"No.  Dragons are very rare, which is fortunate for they
 are also most dangerous.

 Many do say that there is a dragon that dwells in a keep
 in the northernmost realms of Scotia.  Occasionally
 there will come an adventurer bold or foolish enough to
 leave in search of the beast, but I do try my best to
 stop such foolish talk.

 Many have gone to slay the beast, and none have ever
 returned.  That is bad for my business."

"He is a known villain and rogue.  A slippery man.
 Many has been the time when we have expected him to be
 sent to the rope or the blade, yet his life is charmed
 and he has thus far escaped justice.

 I have not seem him for some while, so it may yet be
 that his luck has finally run out.

 'Tis curious, but when last he was here, he was
 talking with Cardinal Bas at our Church.  I care not to
 think what his errand there was, for he surely did not
 visit the church to confess."

"Aye!  Those heathens did come here some years past.

 We welcomed them with the charity often spoke of in the
 scriptures, and they did reward us by desecrating the
 graveyard in our church!

 If ever they return, they shall hang for their deeds!

 'Tis said that they fled north to Scotia, where the
 laws of King Edwyg do not hold."

Before your very eyes, the barman's form shifts into a
winged feline creature.

His eyes glow red as the wings stretch out into
tentacles that streak towards your neck.
