 face-to-face.

 I am the Pope, as well you know.. the first, and most
 trusted of the LORD's servants since His return.

 You may address me as 'Your Holiness'.  But first, the
 LORD bade me deliver a message to you, and a warning."

 who will finally rid us of the scourge of the Demons."

 rid the land of evil, and we must be content with that.

 conquering the inhuman may rally our divine cause, and

 By rights, leaving your own land should have killed you.
 It was the LORD who brought you here, moulding the
 fabric of reality itself to save you from a painful
 death in the cold vacuum of space.

 It is by His command that the Church has shown you
 leniency for sins which have seen others beheaded.

 All this was done that you may serve His will.

 He expects to be repaid for this act of mercy.
