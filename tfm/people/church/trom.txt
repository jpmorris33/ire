 You see a very stern-looking Cardinal.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Greetings, my $Son.  I am Cardinal Trom.

 I hear by way of the Holy Spirit that you are sent among
 us and go with the blessings of the LORD.

 Yet merciful though the Trinity are, I confess I do not
 trust you.
 I shall watch you as hawks do, and if you prove false, I
 shall strike you down with vengeance faster than the
 LORD Himself could deliver.

 Now.  What did you wish to speak with me about?"

 I shall be there waiting to end your evil forever!"

"Aye, and it grieves my heart full sore.

 For this blasphemy, O'Beth's head was chopped off, yet
 still he lives and breathes.  It always worked before!
 
 After hanging and impalement failed likewise, the LORD
 commanded me to cease punishment, and this I have done.

 He must have great need of this Lord O'Beth to grant
 him immortality."

 The Cardinal's already grim expression darkens as he
 begins the Mass.  He points a finger accusingly at the
 congregation, who begin to cower.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Children... as you have now witnessed, the fate of Sodom
 and Gomorrah has fallen upon the unrepentant.
 The sinners who did dwell in the village of New Leuchars
 have been put to justice by the Holy Trinity.

 I know, and the LORD knows, that many here among you are
 equally guilty of the heinous crimes that the men of
 New Leuchars did perpetrate.

 Many of you here do also deserve the slow and painful
 death that has been meted out unto their earthly bodies
 and which they endure still in Hell."

[page="inchurch2"]

"It would be just for the LORD Himself to appear and
 claim that penalty from you this very day, yet He has
 decided in His wisdom and mercy to spare your worthless
 lives in the hopes that the sight of His anger delivered
 unto others may turn you back to the path of the
 righteous and the just.

 I personally do not understand this undue clemency for I
 know that you are all heathen scum who deserve to burn
 for your treacherous dealings with Daemons and witches.

 But the LORD is our God, and He has commanded that your
 lives be spared for now.  His will be done."

"Be thankful that the LORD is merciful, and know that
 your do souls teeter upon the brink of the abyss of
 Hell itself!

 A single mistake and you shall fall.. an eternity of
 torment awaits all who would do deals with the foul
 enemies of the LORD and His son Christ, and the
 Holy Ghost.  Heed well these words!"
