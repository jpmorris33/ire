 I have a very important opening within My organisation
 that I think you would be very well suited for.

 The Church has been governed by a council of three for
 a long, long time, and I have been considering whether
 it might be time to add the Pope as a fourth member and
 expand the Trinity to a Holy Quadruple.

 Of course, if I do go ahead with this plan, I will need
 a replacement for the throne of St. Peter.  You could
 become the next Pope.  How does that sound?"
