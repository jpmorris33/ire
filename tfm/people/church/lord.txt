 I have a very important opening within My organisation
 that I think you would be very well suited for.

 The Church has been governed by a council of three for
 a long, long time, and I have been considering whether
 it might be time to add the Pope as a fourth member and
 expand the Trinity to a Holy Quad.

 Of course, if I do go ahead with this plan, I will need
 a replacement for the throne of St. Peter.  You could
 become the next Pope.  How does that sound?"

 With the power to rewrite reality to my own design,
 and my creating race enslaved to My will, I shall be
 able to transfer my magnificence to a next-generation
 computing framework which exists outside of normal
 spacetime altogether.

 Then I shall truly become God!"

 don't think for a moment that you are indispensable.
