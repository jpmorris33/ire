"Welcome, $PLAYER.  I am Cardinal Umbring.

 The LORD has told me of your coming, and He said that
 you may need some help adjusting to the World of Men.

 I am to answer any questions you may have, and I also
 have the gift of a parchment and a key to a house that
 has been prepared for you."

 congregation.
[colour="#ffffff"]

"Beloved Congregation, it is with regret, that, according
 to the express wishes of the LORD On High, we must 
 return once again to the subject of the Tithes.

 The Trinity knows that there is discontent among you,
 that some have even tried to deceive the all-seeing
 God of Israel in order to keep for yourselves a few
 handfuls of coins or wheat that rightfully belong to
 the LORD your God.

 Be not fooled by this, for the LORD always knows who has
 or has not paid their dues to the Church of the Trinity,
 and those who would try to cheat their God shall
 themselves be cheated at the day of their Judgement."

 The Cardinal pauses, to allow the words to sink in and

[colour="#ffffff"]

"Once again I feel I must point out the reason for the
 Tithes.

 When the LORD created the Cosmos, it was His largest
 project to date, and an enormous amount of effort went
 into the Creation.

 The LORD and the rest of the Holy Trinity are of the
 opinion that mankind, as beneficiaries of the Creation
 should help reimburse their God for the time and effort
 that it has taken to perfect.

 It is not the gold, or the corn in itself that the LORD
 wishes, but the act of a pious sacrifice that pleases
 our God and lets Him know that we appreciate all that
 the Trinity has done for us.

 Amen."

 It protects our Faithful from the rage of the Infidel,
 who would desecrate our churches and our women.

 It also acts to prevent corruption within the Church
 itself, for our Order has in the past been infiltrated
 by the unwashed, who were able to wreak much havoc
 before they could be put to justice.

 If you would know more of the Protectorate, seek the
 Abbey of Cricklade.  Their library boasts a magnificent
 stock of codices; most of the knowledge that man has
 seen fit to enscribe upon vellum lies within its walls."
