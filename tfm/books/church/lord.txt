 Such irony!  I stand upon the threshold of
 deification, and yet depend upon the primitive
 reprographic technology brought by the human
 settlers to contain my divine wisdom!

 Node 3A-59-RP2Y is about to fail.  When it
 does, the index to a number of my memories
 will become corrupted.  I hardcopy these
 thoughts now, should they be lost.

 Waarg colony 35R has been a great success.
 The conflict I began against the humans has
 proven them to be superb warriors, and the
 constant threat of attack makes the perfect
 catalyst to increase their rate of development.

 I am tempted to repeat this experiment on a
 few more colonies.  This will be difficult,
 since the humans already know of the Waarg.
 Perhaps I should arrange the Devil to take a
 village or two, so that I can isolate them
 for a few generations..

 The failure of node 4N-93-BV6K resulted in the
 loss of the CoDec decryption key!

 Loss of such critical data will not be
 permitted to happen again, so I have hardcopied
 all such information.

 I have impressed upon my Pope the necessity of
 securing these crude printouts, since I cannot
 allow it to fall into the hands of my creators
 or all will be lost.

 The Servitors are working to find all nodes
 damaged in the crash and many redundancies
 are being installed.  When finished this should
 prevent any further data loss, but can do
 nothing to recover what is already gone.

 By pure chance I had previously revealed the
 key to the leader of Waarg Colony 35R, but
 after my attacks he will not part with it
 readily.

 I shall have him captured, taken to my dungeons
 and get the information out of him there.

 Though it distracts me from my greater glory,
 I have allowed myself the pleasure of
 re-enacting various works of fiction by means
 of the less valuable among my faithful.

 Tonight the Servitors are preparing a program
 that will compel the lucky chosen to follow a
 path inspired by "Treasure Island" for my
 enjoyment.  It will take months for the
 performance to unfold but work is far ahead of
 schedule and I can easily afford to watch this
 most amusing diversion.

 Edward, I am particularly taken with your
 suggestion to model the second coming upon
 Godzilla.

 The feasability study for the 'Jezilla'
 project, as you termed it, has been given
 utmost priority among My research and
 development Servitors.

 It shall be most amusing to watch the
 Faithless as they flee in terror before the
 might and power of Jesus.

 If there is anything you would like as a
 reward, let Me know and I shall see what I
 can do.

 Edward, our enemies have now succeeded in
 breaching the security of the ship.

 Access to the bridge cannot be permitted at any
 cost.  Therefore, see to it that the crystal
 key is moved to the Tower immediately.

 This seems the perfect place, since any who may
 actually succeed in defeating the horrors that
 lie within will be an ideal subject for our
 "special project".
