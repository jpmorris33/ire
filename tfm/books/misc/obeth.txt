       The Journal of Lord O'Beth, Thane of Mordor

 July 14 1324

 Tonight I beheld three weird Sisters.  Clad in rags the wild
 ones stood and addressed Banquo and I.
 
 They gave unto me seven prophecies upon a tiny scroll, with
 boxes to tick as they come true.  I have put this in a safe
 place, but the prophecies I copy to this journal for study.

 I.   I shall stub my left toe twice on the way home.
     This indeed came to pass before I set quill to vellum.

 II.  King Duncan shall make me a Thane.. yet in spite of this
     grand title I shall be unhappy.  Even as I write it is so, for
     the King bade me rule the foul Northlands of Mordor.

 III. Banquo's son Fleance shall become a Knight of the
     Flower-Children.  He shall renounce his family and all
     worldly goods to live a life of seclusion and peace.

 IV.  No mortal man or woman shall harm me.

 V.   Banquo shall die in a bizarre gardening accident.
      With Fleance out of the way and no royal heir the Crown
      would fall upon me should anything happen to the King.
     
 VI.  There shall be an act of dire Treason.

 VII.  I shall be crowned King of Scotia, and my reign shall
      last unto the End of the World.
