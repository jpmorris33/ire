 The Book of Justice
 by Cardinal Trom
 
 As with all things, sin has many layers, and many punishments
 according to their kind.
 
 Those who do commit petty crimes shall be kept in jail for their
 deeds, deprived of liberty only, until such time as their penance
 be paid in full.
 
 Common crimes, such as murder among the peasantry shall be
 punished by the neck, wherein they shall finish their days at the
 end of a rope while the people do watch them kick and struggle.
 
 Those who commit crimes against the nobility, or nobles who do
 themselves fall into error and sin, shall face the justice of
 beheading, by axe, sword or the falling blade.

 This be a swifter death than the rabble should expect, but also
 a surer fate.  'Tis not unknown for a brigand to swallow a pipe
 of lead and thereby survive the noose, and those skilled in the
 healing arts could revive a hanged man from the brink.

 But once the head be struck from the body, only his holiness the
 Pope himself, or one impossibly skilled at healing magics could
 return the victim to life and health.
 
 Beheading is also the fate which awaits many bandits, for 'tis
 easier to bring in their head alone for the bounty than their
 whole body.  As such, they may lose their head in the woods to
 a barbarian broadsword, or else it be cut from their shoulders
 after death by sword or knife, to take back as a prize.

 Finally, there remains the punishment of burning, for those who
 have offended the LORD Himself, or desecrated His works. Those
 who are so condemned shall be set aflame in the square, that
 all may watch their sufferings in sure knowledge that, reduced
 to mere ashes, they shall never again return to trouble Him or His
 faithful.
